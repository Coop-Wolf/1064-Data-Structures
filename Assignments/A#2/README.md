### Description:

This program creates a dynamically allocated 2d array array with dimensions determined by the user. The program then generates random numbers from 1000 to 5999 that symbolize the social security # of people. The program then goes through various functions. One prints out the matrix of random numbers while another determines whether the numbers of SSN in the 1000's, 2000's and so on. Another function prints out the number of male and female according to the SSN's. This program runs by clicking build, build solutions then clicking Local Windows Debugger.
